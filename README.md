# VidNote

Did you know that more than 1.5 billion people are globally affected by hearing loss? In fact, it even affects 34 million children, and about 95% of these affected children are unable to pursue higher education as a result?

Enter **VidNote**: A powerful application that allows students with hearing disabilities to engage with classroom content. Using an machine learning model, we are able to record the audio that their classmates would be hearing and allow these other students to receive the same information in a concise, easy-to-understand notes format.

This website currently works with Youtube video uploads, but we plan to add options to upload local video files and eventually even live record in the future.
